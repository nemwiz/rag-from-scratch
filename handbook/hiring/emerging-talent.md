Our Emerging Talent strategy ignites GitLab to build toward creating globally inclusive access to opportunities so that everyone can contribute. Emerging Talent, defined as talent with 2 years or less experience in a given domain, will be a value add as GitLab scales. We believe emerging talent adds value to GitLab by [increasing representation](https://joinhandshake.com/blog/employers/diversity-and-inclusion-7-essential-early-talent-recruiting-strategies/) from historically underrepresented and excluded groups and promotes a [healthy organizational structure](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167219842867) for GitLab and its partners

This page outlines the strategy for how we **enable**, **develop**, and **connect** our emerging talent workforce over the next three years at GitLab. Emerging talent is one of our key Talent Acquisition initiatives, this is intended to be a living document that will evolve as the program does.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to **attract**, **acquire**, and **activate** talent to unlock their potential, connecting learning agility with opportunity.

This is anchored in the belief that building a balanced workforce will enable GitLab to scale effectively and inclusively, and that building a strong foundation today will greatly impact our future growth.

## Our Guiding Principles

The guiding principles for the Emerging Talent Program cascade from GitLab’s hiring principles and will set us up to drive change in our organization over the next three years:

- **Inclusion First**
    - We build experiences and programming that contribute to and increases the representation of underrepresented communities at GitLab by being open to anyone, whoever they are, wherever they are*.
    - Our actions are rooted in building a forward-thinking foundation at GitLab with experiences decoupled from academic-based prerequisites, rooted in competency-based assessment.
- **Enable & Develop**
    - We deliver content designed to minimize participants’ time to impact through programming and work-integrated learning.
- **Build For The Long Term**
    - We contribute to GitLab’s [long-term organizational effectiveness](https://dorieclark.com/longgame/) by investing in and building talent, our execution is iterative but our strategy drives toward building a [100-year company](https://bigthink.com/articles/how-to-build-the-100-year-company/).
